# CS 3281: Principles of Operating Systems I (Spring 2020) 
  
**Credit Hours:** 3

## Course Description

This is an introductory course on operating systems. You will learn basic concepts in OS design and implementation. The course content will consist of a balance between theory, concepts, and practical hands-on material. Active participation in class discussions and the Piazza forums is highly encouraged. There really are no dumb questions.

## Prerequisites

CS 3231 and CS 3251. Because an OS must make effective use of the underlying hardware, students learning OS concepts need to have a basic understanding of computer architecture; this is covered in CS 3231. Programming assignments are a major part of the course, and so students must be comfortable with programming and debugging; this is covered in CS 3251. Most of the programming will be done in C.

## Textbook

We are going to follow an online textbook in the course.
The book is freely available at
<http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/>. 

There are also two excellent books that are not required, but are recommended:

* The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk
* Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective by Bryant and O'Hallaron

During the class extra reading material will be provided for each lecture via the github repository. It is your responsibility to read the material before the lecture as there can be a pop quiz at the start of the class. 

## Late submission policy

Submissions are due by midnight on the day listed in the assignment description. Late submissions will be penalized with an automatic 20 percent penalty per day (applied relative to the graded score for the submission).

Assignments submitted more than two days after the due date may receive no credit.

## Late days

You have a total of 7 late days that you can use across programming assignments as you wish. A maximum of two late days can be used on a given programing assignment.

For example: if an assignment is due at 11:59pm on Monday evening, you can use two of your late days to submit that assignment by 11:59pm on Wednesday with no penalty.

**No collaborations unless explicitly permitted**. 

The Vanderbilt Honor Code will govern work done. ANY VIOLATIONS WILL RESULT in the case to be reported to the honor council. You are welcome to refer to the online sources for your assignments. However, you must not copy the code and must provide citation of the source of inspiration if do refer to the online sites. All work will be submitted via GitHub.

In particular, do not plagarize your programming assignments.

## Programming Assignments 

Programming assignments will be tested using Ubuntu and are expected to be developed and run in that environment. You should expect to receive on an average one assignment a week. Assignments will usually be given on a Tuesday and will be due the next Monday by 11:59pm central time.  
The instructions for setting up the environment are available in [the VM Setup document](../vmsetup/vmsetup.md). Any submission that does not compile will be penalized **50%**. 

## Evaluation

The following grading criteria are subject to change. Each graded item in this course will be assigned a certain number of points. Your final grade will be computed as the total number of points you achieved divided by the number of points possible.
The instructor reserves the right to apply a curve to the final grades. In general, I will attempt to achieve the following composition:

## Grading Criteria

| Category        | Percentage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Programming Assignments | 50% | 
| Quizzes + Midterm | 35% |
| Final Project | 10% |
| Attendance | 5% |

We may occasionally have pop quizzes; if you are more than 10 minutes late you cannot take the pop quiz.

## Letter Grade Distribution

| Score        | Letter  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| >= 93.00    |   A      |
| 90.00 - 92.99  |  A-   |
| 87.00 - 89.99 | B+     |
| 83.00 - 86.99  | B     |
| 80.00 - 82.99  | B-     |
| 77.00 - 79.99  | C+  |

| 70.00 - 72.99  | C-  |
| 67.00 - 69.99  | D+  |
| 63.00 - 66.99  | D  |
| 60.00 - 62.99  | D-  |
| <= 59.99   |  F  |


## Disability Statement

Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity
for students with disabilities. If you have a physical or learning
disability, you should ask the Opportunity Development Center to assist
you in identifying yourself to your instructors as having a disability,
so that appropriate accommodation may be provided. Without notification,
your instructors assume that you have no disabilities or seek no
accommodation.

## Emergency Evacuation Plan

 In the event of a fire or other emergency,
the occupants of this class should collect their coats and personal
belongings and leave the building using the stairs. VANDERBILT
UNIVERSITY POLICY FORBIDS REENTRY TO A BUILDING IN WHICH AN ALARM HAS
OCCURRED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION BY VANDERBILT SECURITY. If, in
consequence of a disability, you anticipate the need for assistance,
please discuss that need with the instructors.

If a tornado siren is heard, please go to the nearest interior hallway or interior rooms away from windows.

## Topics

The course will cover the following topics throughout the semester:

-	History of operating systems
-	Architecture of a modern computing system
-	System Calls
-	Interrupts and interrupt handling
-	Process creation, management, and termination
-	Scheduling policies and mechanisms
-	Memory management, virtual memory, paging, dynamic linking and loading of libraries
-	Concurrency, threads, mutual exclusion (mutex and condition variables), including process synchronization (semaphores) and deadlocks
-	Interprocess communication,  signals, message queues, pipes, shared memory, sockets
-	File systems, devices, and interfaces

## Mandatory Reporter Obligations

All University faculty and administrators are mandatory reporters.  What this means is that all Faculty, including me, must report allegations of sexual misconduct and intimate partner violence to the Title IX Coordinator.  In addition, all faculty are obligated to report any allegations of discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator.

We are very willing to discuss with you such incidents should you so desire, but I can only do so in the context of us both understanding my reporting obligations.  If you want to talk with someone in confidence, officials in the Student Health Center, the University Counseling Center, and officials in the Office of the Chaplain and Religious Life (when acting as clergy) can all maintain confidentiality.  In addition, officials in the Project Safe Center (Crisis Hotline: 615-322-7233) have limited confidentiality, in that they have to report the incidents they are told of, but can do so without providing identifying information about the victim(s).
