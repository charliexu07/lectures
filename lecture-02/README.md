* Today we reviewed several things: how to compile and run a program, the shell, CMake, make, and git.
* A terminal is a program that "mimics" an old physical terminal. It runs a shell.
* A shell is a program that acts like a command line interpreter: you type a command, and the shell tries to execute that command. We will use the bash shell in this class.
* make is a program that builds programs for you. You specify dependencies, and make figures out when and how to build the program from those dependencies. The make program uses a Makefile.
* CMake is a program that generates build dependencies. For example, CMake can generate Makefiles, which can then be used to generate an executable or library.
