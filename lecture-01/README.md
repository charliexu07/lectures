Class summary:

- An operating system is a piece of software that makes your hardware useful. We discussed the role of an operating system, and how system calls are how an operating system exposes its functionality to user programs. The C library provides wrapper functions for many of the OS's system calls.
- We also discussed course logistics, including grading.
